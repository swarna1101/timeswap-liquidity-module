# Liquidity Mining Module

Liquidity mining is an investment strategy in which participants within a DeFi protocol contribute their crypto assets to make it easy for others to trade within a platform. In exchange for their contributions, the participants are rewarded with a share of the platform’s fees or newly issued tokens.
The term liquidity means the ease with which an asset can be converted into spendable cash, so the easier it is for an asset to be spent, the more liquid it is. Mining, on the other hand, is a sort of a misnomer in this situation that refers to the more common way of getting rewarded in Proof of Work (PoW) networks such as [Bitcoin](https://finbold.com/topic/bitcoin) for contributing towards verifying transactions.

## How Does Liquidity Mining Work

Participating in these liquidity pools is very simple as it involves depositing your assets into a common pool called a liquidity pool. The process is similar to sending cryptocurrency from one wallet to another. A pool typically consists of a trading pair such as ETH/USDT. As a liquidity miner (or provider), an investor could opt to deposit either asset into the pool.
By depositing their assets into the Defi platforms, the (LPs) make it easier for traders to get into and out of positions with the trading fees partly used to reward them.
The more an LP contributes towards a liquidity pool, the larger the share of the rewards they will receive. Different platforms have varying implementations, but this is the basic idea behind liquidity mining.
Many of the decentralized exchanges run on the foundation of [Automated Market Maker or AMM](https://101blockchains.com/automated-market-makers/) system design. Automated Market Maker or AMM is basically a [smart contract](https://101blockchains.com/what-is-a-smart-contract/), which can facilitate effective regulation of trading. The decentralized nature of smart contracts takes away the need for users to interact with order books of an exchange.
The foundations of liquidity mining with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies started on these platforms with facilities for token swapping. Token swaps allowed the possibility of trading one token for another one in a liquidity pool. Users had to pay specific fees for every trade, such as 0.3% of the value of swapped tokens on  [Uniswap](https://101blockchains.com/uniswap/).

### Key Terms and Concepts

-   **DEX** – this is a short form for  [decentralized exchange](https://finbold.com/guide/best-cryptocurrency-trading-platforms/#2_Decentralized_Exchanges_(DEX)), which is a platform that runs autonomously without direct intervention from a centralized party such as a company. Dexes are trading platforms to which liquidity providers contribute their digital assets.
-   **Yield** – this is the reward offered to liquidity providers in the form of trading fees or LP tokens. In other DeFi platforms, yield is the interest rate accrued to participants for providing liquidity or holding stakes in these projects.
-   **CeFi** – stands for centralized finance, and it refers to the institutions within the cryptocurrency market that offer financial services. It is the opposite of DeFi.
-   **TradFi** – in full, this term stands for traditional finance, and it refers to the conventional financial institutions such as banks, stocks exchanges and hedge funds.TradFi is different from CeFi even though both terms refer to centralized financial structures, the contexts vary because CeFi is used in reference to blockchain and TradFi is used in reference to conventional financial markets.
-   **AMM (Automated market maker)**  – AMMs are smart contracts designed to hold the liquidity reserves within a pool. It is the AMMs to which the LPs deposit their assets and traders interact to exchange their crypto.

### Types of Protocols for Liquidity Mining

-    **Fair Decentralization**


Protocols with fair decentralization focus on developing a fair playing ground for all involved parties. So, fair decentralization protocols are more likely to distribute native tokens equally among early community members and active users.

-   **Progressive Decentralization**


Progressive decentralization is also another important trait in DeFi liquidity mining protocols. Such protocols can facilitate a gradual shift of power to the community by facilitating token distribution in a gradual process. It prevents the possibility of imbalance in the distribution of governance tokens.

-   **Growth Marketing**


The final category of protocols for liquidity farming includes growth marketing protocols, which are completely distinct from other two protocols. Such types of models rely on incentives for community members involved in marketing the project. Therefore, individuals could advertise the  [DeFi protocol](https://101blockchains.com/top-defi-protocols/)  or platform and earn governance tokens as their rewards.



### Terminology associated with Liquidity Mining

-   #### **Decentralized exchanges**


These are  [crypto exchanges](https://www.blockchain-council.org/cryptocurrency/top-cryptocurrency-exchanges-for-trading-cryptocurrencies/)  that allow transactions between two people to take place without the involvement of a third party such as a bank or other financial institution. This form of trade is generally governed by  [smart contracts](https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/decoding-smart-contracts-and-their-used-cases/)  and algorithms and is not owned by a single entity.

-   #### **Liquidity Pools**


These pools allow cryptocurrency owners to save their assets in the form of tokens, which they can later sell on decentralized exchanges. The exchange has complete control over the assets. Participants on the platform might exchange it or utilize it for other reasons. The crypto holder, on the other hand, is entitled to collect their tokens immediately after supplying their assets to the liquidity pool.

When a deal takes place on one of these exchanges, the transaction fee is split among all liquidity providers, and smart contracts control the entire process.

## **Protocols for Liquidity Mining**

Liquidity mining has gained traction since its inception. There are around 120 DeFi platforms with over $80 billion in TVL, according to DeFipulse.

Liquidity Mining protocols can be classified as follows:

-   **Protocols for Fair Decentralization**


The fair decentralization protocol is a concept that tries to level the playing field for all parties involved. Thus the native tokens are distributed evenly to all active users and early community members by the protocol.

Unlike initial coin offerings (ICOs), which require interested investors to purchase a governance token, the fair decentralization protocol approach does not sell the native currency. Instead, it employs various criteria to ensure that tokens are distributed equally. After launch, the fair decentralization protocol immediately transfers authority to the community.

-   **Protocols for progressive or programmatic decentralization**


Progressive decentralization protocols, such as Matrixswap, allow for a progressive transfer of authority to the community. Distributing tokens is a slow process with this approach, and it necessitates establishing a governance model once the project is launched.

Programmatic decentralization is a concept that seeks to prevent an imbalance in the allocation of governance tokens. It keeps whales and institutional traders from amassing large amounts of native tokens.

- ### Protocols for Growth Marketing


The third type of liquidity mining protocol is distinct from the previous two. Developers that use this technique reward members of the community who promote the project. Interested parties must promote the  [DeFi platform](https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-defi-expert-course/)  or protocol in order to get governance tokens.

Protocols employing the growth marketing model are only revealed a few weeks before the launch date, unlike others that have a roadmap months in advance. The initiatives that use this paradigm thrive on publicity.

## Popular DEXes you can consider for your liquidity mining
### 1.  [UniSwap](https://uniswap.org/)
The platform supports Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens (only Ethereum-hosted assets).

To participate in providing liquidity, an investor needs to use a supported Ethereum wallet and deposit Ether to a liquidity pool of their choice. UniSwap offers a governance token called  [UNI](https://uniswap.org/blog/uni)  to liquidity providers with which they can use to vote on various issues as well as claim ownership to:

-   UNI community treasury;
-   The protocol fee switch;
-   uniswap.eth ENS name;
-   Uniswap Default List;
-   SOCKS liquidity tokens

Popular  [liquidity pools on UniSwap](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools)  include:

-   ETH/USDT
-   ETH/USDC
-   ETH/DAI
-   ETH/WBTC

### 2.  [Balancer](https://balancer.fi/)
[Balancer](https://finbold.com/review/balancer-review/) is another Ethereum-focused decentralized exchange giving UniSwap a run for its money.
A major concern for Balancer is that even though the protocol is open and the platform decentralized, the exchange is heavily dependent on Balancer Labs, the company that created it and which runs the DEX’s website through which traders and LPs can access the DEX app.

With Balancer, liquidity pools are not limited to two tokens as the platform supports up to eight different tokens within a single pool. It is more versatile and has a more intuitive user interface than UniSwap. Like its main rival, Balancer LPs and traders will need to use a supported Ether wallet to access and interact with the exchange.

Popular tokens for LPs on the Balancer platform are:

-   WETH
-   BAL
-   USDC
-   DAI
-   WBTC
-   AAVE


## Conclusion
Liquidity mining is becoming increasingly popular amongst crypto investors for a good reason.

-   It offers a great avenue to earn passive income;
-   It contributes towards the decentralization of the blockchain market;
-   It provides investors with an option on what to do with their reserve coins.

Liquidity mining is a type of passive income that allows crypto holders to profit from their present assets instead of holding them in cold storage. In exchange for a proportional distribution of trading fees to each liquidity provider, assets are loaned to a decentralised exchange.
